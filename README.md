# Todo App based on Clean Architecture
## _Example how I understand clean architecture approach in the project_

First of all I need to present domain of the project. What it should do from business point of view.

### Project domain
This is a simple project for managing todo lists with todos.
Application should handle below use cases:
Lists:
- Creates new todo list
- Update todo list name
- Delete todo list
- Provides todos to complete
- Provides todos completed

Todo:
- Add new todo to the list
- Mark todo as completed
- Edit todo description
- Delete todo

So I'm the business here and this is what I would like to do in this sample.
